= Setting up the CJDB =
CUFTS is able to provide both an A-Z list of Journals and a subject based lookup.  The CJDB is an A-Z list of journals, here's how to set it up.

* First, you'll need to have a functional [https://github.com/eanders/CUFTS-Install-Notes/blob/master/CUFTS.mediawiki CUFTS installation].
* Login to your CUFTS installation 
* If you haven't created a site already, visit the Administration -> Sites page and create one.  Make a note of the key.
* Back on the command line
 cd /usr/local/CUFTS 
* Create '''/usr/local/CUFTS/lib/CUFTS/CJDB/Loader/MARC/sitekey.pm''', where '''sitekey''' is the key used when you created the site, with the following contents:
 package CUFTS::CJDB::Loader::MARC::sitekey;
 use base ('CUFTS::CJDB::Loader::MARC');
 1;
* Run 
 perl util/update_cjdb.pl
* The public interface for the CJDB should now be available here:
 http://server.marlboro.edu/CJDB/sitekey/
